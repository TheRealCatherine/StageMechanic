# Stage Mechanic

## Scope of project

We are creating a game engine that allows one to create, share, and play block-based games including both block-pushing games in the spirit of Catherine, Robo5, and Pushmo as well as simple block-based platform games in the spirit of Bloxels.

## Target audences

We aim to be a solid foundation on which to build block-pushing and simple block-platorm games, both OpenSource and commercial in nature.

We also target both the amateur/casual player of Catherine, Robo5, and Pushmo looking for a more convenient way to practice individual parts of the game as well as professional/aspiring competitive and speedrun players looking to test times/results of different solves without the overhead associated with a full game.

Another target audience is the aspiring game-maker coming from something like Bloxels that wants a 3d environment and potentially unlimited control over their creation. For this audience we hope to provide not only easy-to-use features in our custom level editor and the ability to import Bloxels boards, levels, and animations - but the full source code to our Unity-based engine, allowing creators to leverage all of the easy-to-use features we provide on top of Unity's excellent and extensive Cross-Platform game engine.

## Current state

We are currently working toward an initial official release, but many features already work and preview versions are available for download.

* Block-themes (visual styling)
* Catherine/Robo5-style gravity, EDGE, and other block mechanics
* Catherine/Robo5-style player characters (that is players that can push and pull blocks, climb blocks, hang on blocks, etc)
* Up to 3 players (local co-op) on any stage
* 99 undos - can undo even after death
* Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android builds
* Keyboard/Mouse input
* XBox 360 controller input

### Currently in progress
* Player movement animantion
* Bloxels-style blocks
* Bloxels-style player characters (that is players that can jump, shoot, etc)

## Contribting

This project is being developed entirely by volunteers and is managed by a software industry veteran in her spare time. If there is anything you would like to work on please [join our Discord chat](https://discord.gg/TBU4MyE) and let us know. Pretty much no matter what it is we can find a way to fit it in. Our project manager often says "do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want" and applies this not only to life but to project management.

### Tools/technologies used

* Game Engine: Unity Personal 2018.1beta
* Primary Scripting Language: C# 6.0
* 3D Modeling: Blender
* 2D Painting: Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Filter Forge

Note: Contributors may use other tools that work with the common formats so long as they have appropriate licenses to use those tools for creating contributions to a BSD+CC0 licensed project. For example the Student version of Z-Brush is not compatible because it only allows educational use.
