### What works:

### Currently in progress

## Licensing

This project is being developed as an Open Source project entirely by volunteers. The resulting application is made freely available to users and all source code made free available to developers/artists/etc.

We are using the BSD 3-clause license. This allows maximum freedom while protecting contributors. Essentially anyone is allowed to do whatever they want to with anything published as part of this project. 

Please note that some individual assets may be under other, compatible licenses inclyding CC0, CC-BY, or the Unity Store license. Please see in-game credits, asset filenames, in-folder license files, and the LICENSE-EXCEPTIONS file for additional information.

## Contribting

This project is being developed entirely by volunteers and is managed by a software industry veteran in her spare time. If there is anything you would like to work on please [join our Discord chat](https://discord.gg/TBU4MyE) and let us know. Pretty much no matter what it is we can find a way to fit it in. Our project manager often says "do what you want, when you want, for as long as you want" and applies this not only to life but to project management.

### Tools/technologies used

* Game Engine: Unity Personal 2018
* Primary Scripting Language: C# 6.0
* 3D Modeling: Blender
* 2D Painting: Photoshop, Clip Studio Paint, Filter Forge

Note: Contributors may use other tools that work with the common formats so long as they have appropriate licenses to use those tools for creating contributions to a BSD+CC0 licensed project. For example the Student version of Z-Brush is not compatible because it only allows educational use.
