Thanks for your interest in StageMechanic - an Open Source block-pushing game platform from You're Perfect Studio.

===
What are these files?
===

These are stage definition files for StageMechanic that are not included as built-in levels.

.json files are desktop/laptop and the .bin files are for mobile devices.

===
Why are there separate Mobile and Desktop files?
===

Due to a known bug in Unity, the game engine that provides the lower level parts of StageMechanic, reading .json files is not functioning on Android devices.

Please visit: https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/system-dot-configuration-dot-configurationerrorsexception-failed-to-load-configuration-section-for-datacontractserializer

and 'vote' for this bug so that we can support .json save files on all platforms.

===
Why not use .bin on all platforms?
===

We try to do everything as open as we can. We want our users to know that we are not storing any personal information in their save files. With the .json files anyone can read it and see what is going on. With .bin files, all the information is encoded in an unreadable format.
